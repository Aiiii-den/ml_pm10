### Sprint 5: 03.06 - 16.06.2024

#### Phase Two - Data acquistion and exploration:
__Part 5:__ 
- in depth analysis of new year since previous sprints showed extreme spikes during events which contain fire and explosives
- got advise from fellow students about current events which could influence recent data
- plotting pm10 average for yearly comparison
- plotting pm10 monthly average for yearly comparison
- take care of different time zones due to time changes --> 1. convert to string, 2. cut the time zone information, 3. turn back into datetime data type
- add wind data --> analyse, merge and explore

#### Decisions:
- Include Covid? Or not include covid?

#### Next step:
- Daily comparison (hourly) weekday vs weekend add all values for one time over the whole year (exclude easter and new year)
