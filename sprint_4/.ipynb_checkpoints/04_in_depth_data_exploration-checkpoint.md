### Sprint 4: 20.05. - 02.06.2024

#### Phase Two - Data aquistion and exploration:
__Part 4:__ 
- changed weather station to Tempelhof-SchÃ¶neberg since it's closer to my home and more interesting to me -- furthermore offers more years of pm10 measurements
- acquisition of the complete dataset by using a script to call the api and loop through the parameter
- in depth analysis of easter since previous sprint showed extreme spikes during events which contain fire 
- encountered issues with time change and missing / extra data points
    - decision: missing - use (n(h-1)+n(h+1)/2) as value --> average of the value an hour before and an hour after the missing data point
                extra - if data is identical: remove the extra datapoint, otherwise use the average value for the hour in question
                do not change time zone to UTC since habits (communting, etc) are the same no matter the time change and just using UTC would miscrue those circumstances
- found inconsistent data type for the datetime attribute - sometimes datetype and othertimes just a string
    - clean up
    - problem in month with time change since it doesn't know how to deal with them --> probably need to split the dataset at the exact day/hour
 
#### Decisions:
- missing datapoints:u se (n(h-1)+n(h+1)/2) as value --> average of the value an hour before and an hour after the missing data point
- extra datapoints: if data is identical: remove the extra datapoint, otherwise use the average value for the hour in question
- time change: do not change time zone to UTC since habits (communting, etc) are the same no matter the time change and just using UTC would miscrue those

#### Next step:
- Analyse new year
- Clean up data (time change)
