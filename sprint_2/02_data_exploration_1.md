### Sprint 2: 22.04. - 05.05.2024

### Phase Two - Data aquistion and exploration:
__Part 2:__ 
- first data exploration to help get an understanding of the data and figure out an appropriate modell family
    - ydata_profiling & manual correlation heatmap --> add the ydata_profiling to the notebook seperately?
- TWO OPTIONS: time series prediction (applicable for weather station who measure pm10) OR regression (train on weather station which has all neccessary data points to predict pm10 for weather station which don't predict it by themselves)
- Final decision: time series prediction since analysis showed that no other measured particle has a strong correlation to pm10 (except pm25; however, most of the time pm25 also isn't measure when pm10 isn't measured)

#### Decisions:
- time series prediction since analysis

#### Next steps:
- further data exploration for time series predcition
